# PinW-Cellulair-automata-project
Cellulair automata (CA) is a discrete model. CA consists of a regular grid of cells and each grid can be in one state of a finitive number of states. The simplest number of states is a boolean state (0 or 1). Example: 0 stands for dead cells and 1 for living cells.
